## Useful paper

- Great general intro to single cell analysis. BUT: the software list is already completely out of date and misses most modern deep learning based packages) [Leygeber, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2019.04.025)
- Great intro in reproducible workflows [Miura, 2021](https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105889)

## Useful papers for advanced feature extraction

This list mostly contains papers by ourselves, for the simple reason that we are familiar with the methods used in them. There are many other good papers out there from other labs too, of course!
